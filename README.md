# AI Agent Learning Journey

A 4-week intensive learning project focused on building production-ready Teams bots with AI agents using N8N and LangGraph.

## Overview

This repository documents my journey from Teams bot basics to building a complete, production-ready AI operations assistant. Each week builds upon the previous, culminating in a Disney-ready demo project.

## Learning Plan

See the complete 4-week learning plan: [`ai_agent_learning_plan.md`](ai_agent_learning_plan.md)

## Structure

```
